## Project status update

This project has been created for the purpose of completion of Project 4. The base of the project is influenced by Code Institute blog walkthrough project.
In line with Project 4 requirements an addtitional functionality was created to allow users to submit blog content requests.

AllVintage blog is created with the purpose of being a site where users can find interesting articles about old items, and be part of an online community of vintage enthusiastics.  AllVintage blog has a page Administrator, to create, update and delete posts.  Users can sign up, sign in/out, comment and like posts, complete form to suggest posts, engage with other users of the blog community, and engage with the page Administrator.

Due to time constraints and some some challenges with deployment to Heroku, the project is incomplete at the time of the submission.
The remaining aspect, which need to completed are as follows:
-completion of CRUD functonality specifically to allow logged users to delete and amend their comments
-additional styling is required to make the blog more appealing to users
-code testing 
-code commenting across code files
-completion of the readme document, including database schema and wireframes

## Project 4

### Background

## Design 

## Solution 

The solutions below were used for this blog project

**Database structure**
The blog site needs a database structure in order to be able to support required functionality such as blog posts, comments, likes, user and content request.
Postgresql was used for the purpose of supporting database related needs of the site.

The below image reflects the database structure.

**Code languages** 
In order to create this blog site HTML, CSS and Python languages were used. HTML was used to create the initial framework of the blog, with Python supporting more complex elements of its functionality.
The CSS was used for styling of the blog site.

**Development**

-Deployment and application hosting
The application was deployed, and it is hosted on Heroku.  Further details are documented in the deployment section below.

## Wireframes

In the process of development a subset of wireframes have been created using Balsamiq application.
Wireframes help to visualise the user experience within the application.

Wireframes have been completed for desktop and mobile users.

## Potential future developments

This is a list of potential features/enhancements to be developed, in order to improve user's experience within the blog 
*Include the Search function in the navigation bar, to allow users to look for specific items.
*Enlarge blog images
*Include videos in each blog post
*Add a live chat for registered users within the posts, with the aim of enforcing community engagement
*Add section to ask registered users if they wish to be notified each time a new post/article is uploaded/published in the blog

## Testing 

The testing of the project included functional testing to confirm correct functionality of various blog's components. In addtion also a code testing was completed as part of project development.

**Functional testing**

The functional testing was completed manually with a number of test scripts and related outcomes reflected in the below.
The functional testing was focused on the homepage and blog's posts, user as well as admin testing. The testing has been deemed as successful.
